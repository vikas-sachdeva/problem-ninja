Given an array of size n, the array contains numbers in range from 0 to k-1 where k is a positive integer and k <= n. 
Find the maximum repeating number in this array. 

Expected time complexity is O(n) and extra space allowed is O(1). Modifications to array are allowed.

**Example-1**:

**Input**: 

    arr[] = {1, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 3, 8, 0, 9, 2, 3}
    k = 10

**Output**:
    
    2
